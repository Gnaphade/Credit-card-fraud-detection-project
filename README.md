# Credit-card-fraud-detection-project
In this project , I have to used Python language and Machine Learning alogorithms. Total data is 284807 and fraud content is 492. In Python language used Python Libraries like Numpy , Pandas , Seaborn , Matplotlib , Sklearn. If credit card is fraud then value become 1 and credit card is not fraud then value become 0. In that Two performance are there i.e. Performing cross validation with RepeatedKFold and Performing cross validation with StratifiedKFold. In that using machine learning algorithm i.e. Logistic Regression ,KNN , Decision Tree , Random Forest , Xgboost , SVM. Final result in Performing cross validation with StratifiedKFold in Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization value near to 1.
